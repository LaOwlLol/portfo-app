		<h3 class="list"> Electronic Lab Management (ELM) Notebooks: </h3>
		<p class="indented">ELM Notebooks was the product of my group's capstone project for CS464 Principals of Human-Computer Interaction course at CSU.  For this project we used a contextual inquiry approach to conduct observations/interviews with laboratory biologists in a real lab setting.  Later we applied user-centered design techniques to prototype an application meant to improve their workflow by eliminating breakdowns which were identified in the observation/interview stage.</p>

		<p class="indented">The following links display some of the work we accomplished.</p>
